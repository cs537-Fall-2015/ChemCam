1) Clone this down to your pc...
2) If you are using Eclipse. Make sure you add the /libs/gson-2.3.1.jar to your build path. Google is your best friend, if you don't know how...
3) Compile and run /src/chemcam/Main.main or run ChemCamSimulator\dist\ChemCamSimulator.jar
4) The GUI should be very self explanatory. There are 4 buttons:
	a) Clear button is to clear command editor.
	b) Send button is to send commands, after you are done editting them.
	c) Load is to load predetermined text file. The file should be here <wherever-you-cloned>\ChemCamSimulator\src\chemcam\data\commands.txt
	d) Save button is to save the commands, that you have editted to any where you want. 
   There are of course checks in place to make sure you are not sending bogus command or incomplete commands list to the agent.
5) There's also a drop down menu for you to select predetermined commands. Checks are also in place for this functionality.
6) Last thing, please don't mess with <wherever-you-cloned>\ChemCamSimulator\src\chemcam\data\data.txt. That's the dummy data file that the program needs...
7) Report any bug you find to the next unlucky group that comes along...
